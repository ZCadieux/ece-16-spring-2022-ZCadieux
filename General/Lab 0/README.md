## Tutorials

The first tutorial led me through the basics of design, looking at problem definition, designing a solution, and building and testing the solution. It emphasized the importance of understanding needs and scoping out a problem.

The second tutorial led me through how to use Git, and I created the example repo following along with the tutorial to practice creating repositories, pushing new files, and familiarizing myself with how to use Git to manage my files.

## Challenge 1

The Design Challenge asked me to scope out a user group and a problem they face, and ask questions about how those users interact with that problem and other related information. I chose to look at students in online learning environments, and how effectively they are able to learn.
