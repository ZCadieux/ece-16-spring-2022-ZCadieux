## Design Challenge

[//]: <> (Response)
For my design challenge, I chose to look at students learning online, such as undergrads over the last few years, and others who choose to learn in online formats from other sources. All of these students are taking classes of some format, and trying to learn content via these classes. Some important questions to ask about students learning in this way center around the effectiveness of this learning modality. Do students retain information from online classes? Is student attendance and engagement significantly lower compared to traditional in person formats? Do students get extra fatigue from online classes? Is there room for online class to augment traditional in person classes, or be provided in addition to it rather than as a seperate modality?

Looking online, and through my own experience, generally most of these questions are answered by students forced online by COVID-19, rather than students who may have opted into online classes offered by various services or schools that specifically target online learning. Based on this being the more vocal group, it took a bit more digging to find examples of people interested in online learning over in person learning, and those individuals greatly enjoy that experience, and seem to gain as much from it as people taking traditional classes. Thus, I think that a problem with students learning online is that their mindset is targeted towards in person classes, and the approach and mentality is not conducive to learning effectively online.
